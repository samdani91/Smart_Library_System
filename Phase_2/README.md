# üìÅ Phase_2 ‚Äì Smart Library System (Microservices Architecture)

## üìå Overview

In the microservices version of the Smart Library System, the application is divided into three independent services ‚Äî each responsible for a specific domain: User, Book, and Loan. Every service has its own database and communicates with others via HTTP APIs (no queues or Kafka involved in this version).

---

## üß© Services Overview

### 1. üë• User Service
Handles registration, profile management, and user-related queries.
- üö™ REST Base Path: /api/users
- üì¶ Owns a user database.

### 2. üìö Book Service
Manages book inventory, search, and updates to availability.
- üö™ REST Base Path: /api/books
- üì¶ Owns a book database.

### 3. üîÅ Loan Service
Issues and returns books by communicating with both User Service and Book Service.
- üö™ REST Base Path: /api/loans
- üì¶ Owns a loan database.


## üõ¢Ô∏è  Databases (One per service)

| Service         | Database   | Tables  |
|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **User Service**| `user_db`  | `users` |
| **Book Service**| `book_db`  | `books` |
| **Loan Service**| `loan_db`  | `loans` |

# üîó Inter-Service Communication

## Communication Patterns

In this microservices architecture, services communicate with each other through synchronous HTTP/REST APIs. Here‚Äôs how the communication flows:

### ‚û°Ô∏è Direct Service-to-Service Communication

The **Loan Service** directly calls APIs exposed by the **User Service** and **Book Service**.

#### Example Flow (Book Issuing):
- Calls `GET /api/users/{id}` to verify the user exists
- Calls `GET /api/books/{id}` to check book availability
- Calls `PATCH /api/books/{id}/availability` to update book availability

---

## üîß Implementation Details

- **Service URLs:**  
  In development, services may use predefined URLs:  
  `http://user-service:8081`  
  `http://book-service:8082`

- **HTTP Clients:**  
  Services use HTTP clients to make REST API calls.

- **Circuit Breakers:**  
  Implement circuit breakers to handle service failures gracefully.

- **Timeout Handling:**  
  Set appropriate timeouts to prevent cascading failures across services.

---

## üîÅ Example: Loan Creation Flow

When a client sends a request to create a loan:

1. **Client sends** `POST /api/loans` ‚Üí **Loan Service**
2. **Loan Service performs:**
   - `GET /api/users/{user_id}` ‚Üí **User Service**
   - `GET /api/books/{book_id}` ‚Üí **Book Service**
   - `PATCH /api/books/{book_id}/availability` ‚Üí **Book Service**
   - `INSERT` into `loan_db.loans`
3. Returns response to Client

---

## üö® Error Handling

- If **User Service** is unavailable ‚Üí `503 Service Unavailable`
- If **Book Service** is unavailable ‚Üí `503 Service Unavailable`
- If the **user doesn‚Äôt exist** ‚Üí `404 Not Found`
- If the **book doesn‚Äôt exist** or **no copies available** ‚Üí `400 Bad Request`

**Note:** No shared database. Each service is data-isolated to ensure decoupling and autonomy.

# üß™ API Documentation (Microservices)

Each microservice exposes RESTful APIs for client and inter-service communication.

## API Design Principles

- **RESTful Architecture:** Access resources via standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **JSON Payloads:** Use JSON format for all requests and responses
- **Service Isolation:** Each service maintains its own API namespace and database
- **Stateless Communication:** Servers do not store client state between requests
- **Proper Status Codes:** Use HTTP status codes to indicate:
  - Success (2xx)
  - Client Errors (4xx)
  - Server Errors (5xx)

> The following endpoints demonstrate core functionality of each microservice. You are encouraged to add more APIs to fulfill additional requirements or use cases.
