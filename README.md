# 📚 Smart Library System – Full Project Roadmap

The **Smart Library System** is a multi-phase software development project that progressively evolves from a monolithic application into a fully containerized, microservices-based system with reverse proxy and orchestration using Docker.

This project is ideal for developers and students aiming to learn practical backend architecture, REST API design, and modern deployment workflows in a real-world library management context.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Monolithic Smart Library System

We begin with a **monolithic design**, where all components of the system reside in a single codebase under one runtime environment.

🧠 **Learning Outcome:**

- How to structure a monolithic Node.js application  
- Building core modules: Users, Book Catalog, Borrowing  
- Why monoliths become difficult to scale and maintain  
- Clean code structure: `Controller → Service → Repository` layers  
- RESTful API design with Express and MongoDB  

📁 See: [`/Phase_1`](./Phase_1)

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Transition to Microservices

In this phase, we decompose the monolith into **independent services**, each responsible for a distinct business capability (e.g., Users, Books, Loans).

🧠 **Learning Outcome:**

- Service decomposition by domain boundaries  
- Designing RESTful communication between services  
- Managing independent databases for each service  
- Concepts of **loose coupling** and **bounded contexts**

📁 To be added: [`/Phase_2`](./Phase_2)

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: Reverse Proxy with Nginx

We integrate **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to manage internal routing and external access across microservices.

🧠 **Learning Outcome:**

- Basics of reverse proxying  
- Writing Nginx configuration for service routing  
- Centralized control of HTTPS, caching, static files  
- Load balancing and API gateway concepts  

📁 To be added: [`/Phase_3`](./Phase_3)

---

## 🐳 Phase 4: Containerization with Docker

Each microservice is **containerized using Docker**, ensuring consistent runtime environments across development, testing, and production.

🧠 **Learning Outcome:**

- Writing `Dockerfile`s for Node.js services  
- Building and running containers  
- Isolating environments with Docker networks and volumes  
- Best practices for image management  

📁 To be added: `/Phase_4`

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Managing with Docker Compose

With more moving parts, we adopt **Docker Compose** to orchestrate and run multi-container environments effortlessly.

🧠 **Learning Outcome:**

- Defining environments in `docker-compose.yml`  
- Setting up service dependencies and environment variables  
- Inter-service networking and shared volumes  
- Simplifying local development and CI workflows  

📁 To be added: `/Phase_5`

---

## 📌 Final Goal

By the end of this project, you’ll have built a **production-ready library system** that is:

- Modular and scalable  
- REST API-based and stateless  
- Backed by MongoDB (or pluggable DB support)  
- Containerized and orchestrated for modern deployments  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Progressive)

- **Node.js** & **Express** (Backend APIs)  
- **MongoDB** (Database)  
- **Nginx** (Reverse Proxy / Gateway)  
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (Containerization)  
- (Optional) Swagger / Postman for API testing and documentation  

---

## 📜 Testing

Each service has its own unit and integration tests. There are also end-to-end tests that verify the interaction between services.

## 🧠 Notes

This project is a practical showcase of my backend and DevOps learning journey. It can be used as a learning resource or starter template by others following a similar path.
