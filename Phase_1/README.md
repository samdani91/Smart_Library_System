# 📁 Phase_1 – Smart Library System (Monolithic Architecture)

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains the **Phase 1** implementation of the Smart Library System using a **monolithic architecture**. The system integrates all core functionalities — user management, book cataloging, and book loan tracking — into a single, unified Node.js application.

This version is ideal for simple deployments where services are tightly coupled and managed as a single unit.

## 🛢️ Unified Database Schema

| Table  | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `users` | Stores user information.           |
| `books` | Stores book catalog details.       |

### 📐 API Design Principles

- **RESTful Architecture**: Resources accessed using HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- **JSON Payloads**: All requests and responses use JSON.
- **Consistent Naming**: Endpoints follow the format `/api/{resource}`.
- **Stateless Communication**: No client state is stored on the server between requests.
- **Proper Status Codes**: Uses standard HTTP codes:  
  - `200 OK`, `201 Created` for success  
  - `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found` for client errors  
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for server errors
