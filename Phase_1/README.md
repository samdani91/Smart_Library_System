### üìê API Design Principles

- **RESTful Architecture**: Resources accessed using HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- **JSON Payloads**: All requests and responses use JSON.
- **Consistent Naming**: Endpoints follow the format `/api/{resource}`.
- **Stateless Communication**: No client state is stored on the server between requests.
- **Proper Status Codes**: Uses standard HTTP codes:  
  - `200 OK`, `201 Created` for success  
  - `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found` for client errors  
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for server errors
